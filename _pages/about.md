Hello!

I'm a final-year Software Engineering student at UPC with a passion for web application development—especially backend solutions and AI-powered applications.

During my time at university, I’ve been the Vice President of the IEEE Computer Society chapter, which brings together students from Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Cybersecurity. I’m also a GitHub Campus Expert, which has allowed me to empower students, build and help tech communities, and lead impactful initiatives. Oh, and I'm a Microsoft Student Ambassador too (Gold milestone)! Thanks to this program, I’ve had the opportunity to train and deliver workshops on development, AI, and education to students in my country.

I believe the best way to learn, grow, and give back is through teaching! That’s why I share programming tutorials on Instagram to help others. You can check them out [here](https://www.instagram.com/the.james.dev/)!

Outside of tech, I spend my time:

- 📖 Reading – Novels, sci-fi, and the occasional self-development book (Stoicism, mostly)
- 🏃 Running – Not a marathoner (yet), but I run to clear my mind and recharge
- ✈️ Traveling – Exploring new places and cultures is the best way to learn
- 📷 Photography – Capturing moments, because memories deserve high resolutio
